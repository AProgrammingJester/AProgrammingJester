# Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler Bryant, I'm a third-year Computer Science student at SNHU with a focus on Software Engineering.

âš¡ Fun fact: When Iâ€™m not studying or working, I enjoy listening to Japanese artists like MAN WITH A MISSION, Polkadot Stingray, and Mone Kamishiraishi. I also love to readâ€”right now, Iâ€™m reading Halo: The Flood.

ðŸ“« My current courses are CS 230 Operating Systems and CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle.
