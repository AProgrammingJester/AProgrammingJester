# Hi, I’m Tyler Bryant, I'm a third-year Computer Science student at SNHU with a focus on Software Engineering.

⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not studying or working, I enjoy listening to Japanese artists like MAN WITH A MISSION, Polkadot Stingray, and Mone Kamishiraishi. I also love to read—right now, I’m reading Halo: The Flood.

📫 My current courses are CS 305 Software Security and CS 319 UI/UX Design and Development.

Forgetting and making mistakes doesn’t mean you're failing, it means you're learning. That's the whole point of practicing.
