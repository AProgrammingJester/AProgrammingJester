### Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler-Bryant, a second-year Computer Science student at SNHU with a focus on Software Engineering. Iâ€™ve been thoroughly enjoying my courses so far.

## âš¡ Fun fact: when Iâ€™m not studying or working, I enjoy listening to Japanese artists like Man With a Mission, Polkadot Stingray, and Mone Kamishiraishi. Their music keeps me energized and inspired even while I work!
## ðŸ”­ My current courses are MAT 350 Applied Linear Algebra and CS 210 Programming Languages.
## ðŸŒ± So far, during my academic journey, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to use programming and query languages such as Python, Java, C++, and MySQL.
