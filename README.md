### Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler Bryant, I'm a third-year Computer Science student at SNHU with a focus on Software Engineering.

## âš¡ Fun fact: when Iâ€™m not studying or working, I enjoy listening to Japanese artists like Man With a Mission, Polkadot Stingray, and Mone Kamishiraishi. Their music keeps me energized and inspired even while I work!
## ðŸ”­ My current courses are CS 230 Operating Systems and CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle.
