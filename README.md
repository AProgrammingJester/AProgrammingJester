# Hi, I’m Tyler Bryant, I'm a third-year Computer Science student at SNHU with a focus on Software Engineering.

📫 My current courses are CS 340 Client/Server Development and CS 350 Emerging Sys Arch & Tech. Upcoming courses are CS 360 Mobile Architect & Programming and CS 370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS.

Forgetting and making mistakes doesn’t mean you're failing, it means you're learning. So keep on coding.
